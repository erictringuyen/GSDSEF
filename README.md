Solubility is an important property that indicates how well a compound dissolves in water or other solvents. Traditional methods for measuring solubility, such as lab tests, are time-consuming and resource-intensive. This project aims to develop advanced machine learning (ML) models to predict solubility faster, with the goal of achieving an R-squared (RÂ²) of at least 0.9 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below 0.5.
